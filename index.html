# TextYoga Privacy Policy

At Paper Board Labs, we are committed to providing a focused reading experience through the TextYoga Chrome extension. We believe in local storage and local cloud solutions to ensure user privacy. This policy outlines how TextYoga handles user data.

## Data Collection & Usage

TextYoga does not collect or store any user data. Paper Board Labs adheres to a strict policy of not utilizing trackers or storing user information in any circumstances. 

## Functionality & Permissions

The following permissions are necessary for TextYoga to operate:

*   **Active Tab Justification:** This permission is required to allow the extension to access and modify the content of the currently active webpage. This enables TextYoga to remove distractions and reformat text for enhanced readability.
*   **Storage Justification:**  The extension utilizes storage to save user preferences locally on the user’s device. These preferences include text size, line spacing, theme settings, and auto-activation domains. This data is stored locally and is not transmitted to any external servers.
*   **Scripting Justification:**  TextYoga employs scripting to inject content scripts that analyze webpage structure and apply text-focused styling transformations. This functionality operates entirely within the context of the webpage itself.
*   **Context Menus Justification:** The extension provides right-click menu options, allowing users to quickly activate or deactivate TextYoga on any webpage.
*   **Host Permission:** TextYoga requires host permission to function on all websites, enabling users to transform any webpage into a distraction-free reading experience.

## Remote Code

It is important to note that TextYoga does not utilize remote code. All processing and functionality occur within the user’s browser environment.

## Security

We employ standard security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity of the extension.

## Updates to this Policy

At Paper Board Labs, we reserve the right to update this privacy policy. Any changes will be communicated to users through updates to the extension’s description.
