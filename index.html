    <h1>TextYoga Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>At Paper Board Labs, we are committed to providing a focused reading experience through the TextYoga Chrome extension. We believe in local storage and local cloud solutions to ensure user privacy. This policy outlines how TextYoga handles user data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection & Usage</h2>

    <p>TextYoga does not collect or store any user data. Paper Board Labs adheres to a strict policy of not utilizing trackers or storing user information in any circumstances.</p>

    <h2>Functionality & Permissions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Active Tab Justification:</strong> This permission is required to allow the extension to access and modify the content of the currently active webpage. This enables TextYoga to remove distractions and reformat text for enhanced readability.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Storage Justification:</strong> The extension utilizes storage to save user preferences locally on the user’s device. These preferences include text size, line spacing, theme settings, and auto-activation domains. This data is stored locally and is not transmitted to any external servers.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Scripting Justification:</strong> TextYoga employs scripting to dynamically inject content scripts only when users manually activate the extension on a webpage through the extension icon or right-click menu. These scripts analyze webpage structure and apply text-focused styling transformations to create a distraction-free reading experience. Scripts are never injected automatically or without explicit user action. This functionality operates entirely within the context of the active webpage and requires no data transmission to external servers.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Context Menus Justification:</strong> The extension provides right-click menu options, allowing users to quickly activate or deactivate TextYoga on any webpage.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Host Permission:</strong> TextYoga requires host permission to function on all websites, enabling users to transform any webpage into a distraction-free reading experience.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Remote Code</h2>

    <p>It is important to note that TextYoga does not utilize remote code. All processing and functionality occur within the user’s browser environment.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>We employ standard security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity of the extension.</p>

    <h2>Updates to this Policy</h2>

    <p>At Paper Board Labs, we reserve the right to update this privacy policy. Any changes will be communicated to users through updates to the extension’s description.</p>
